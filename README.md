OohLaLog Handler for java.util.logging


This is handler for java.util.logging that sends logs to the Oohlalog Cloud Logging Service. 
##Usage/Configuration

This is a handler, just like any other you might use for java.util.logging.  The only difference is that this handler takes one required parameter, your OohLaLog
apiKey.  For a tutorial on how to use java.util.logging, see [here][0].
```
org.apache.commons.logging.Log=com.oohlalog.commons.OohLaLogLogger
```

Additional configuration options are to be placed in an alternative properties file, oohlalog.properties.  
The only required property to include is your OohLaLog authToken.  
Similarly to the Commons standard, you have the ability to specify whether you would like to see the full log name, the shortened version of the name, or both.

You also can specify the minimum loggign level for the logger.  For example, if set to "warn", only messages of equal severity or higher will be logged.

Specific to OohLaLog, you have the ability to configure how often logs are uploaded to the OohLaLog server, in addition to having control over which statistics 
you would like uploaded. 

Below is an example oohlalog.properties file.
```
# Must set the authToken.
com.oohlalog.commons.authToken=1f111a85-62c7-4f42-8dd9-8a10bb80dc6e

# Optional: Show the log name in every message. 
# Defaults = false.
com.oohlalog.commons.showLogName=false

# Optional: Show the last component of the name to be output with every message. 
# Default = true.
com.oohlalog.commons.showShortName=true

# Optional: Logging level for all instances of OohLaLogLogger.
# Must be either trace, debug, info, warn, error or fatal. 
# Default = info.
com.oohlalog.commons.defaultlog=info

# Optional: Amount of time in milliseconds before an automatic flush of all logs (lower numbers impact app performance)
# Default = 10000
com.oohlalog.commons.timeBuffer=10000

# Optional: Amount of time in milliseconds before an automatically posting usage statistics to OohLaLog (lower numbers impact app performance)
# Default = 60000
com.oohlalog.commons.statsBuffer=60000

# Optional: Number logs to buffer before posting to OohLaLog (lower numbers impact app performance)
# Default = 150
com.oohlalog.commons.maxBuffer=150

# Optional: Do you want Memory Statistics to be posted to OohLaLog
# Default = true
com.oohlalog.commons.showMemoryStats=true

# Optional: Do you want CPU Statistics to be posted to OohLaLog
# Default = true
com.oohlalog.commons.showCPUStats=true

# Optional: Do you want File System Statistics to be posted to OohLaLog
# Default = true
com.oohlalog.commons.showFileSystemStats=true

# Optional: Specifies whether or not you would like to send any usage statistics to OohLaLog.  
#           This option has greater priority than showMemoryStats, showCPUStats, and showFileSystemStats
# Default = true
com.oohlalog.commons.Stats=true

# Optional: Logging detail level for an OohLaLogLogger instance named MyClassLogger.
# Must be either trace, debug, info, warn, error or fatal. Defaults to the
# above default if not set.
com.oohlalog.commons.log.MyClassLogger=warn

```
